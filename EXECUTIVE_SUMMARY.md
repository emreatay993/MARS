## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives & Outcomes

| Objective                                             | Result |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Rebrand and align the application with the MARS name  | âœ… New UI title, documentation, and messaging |
| Modularise the legacy monolithic codebase             | âœ… 36 organised Python modules (45 Python files including package initialisers) with clear package boundaries |
| Preserve solver functionality and workflows           | âœ… Batch, time-history, animation, and export features intact |
| Improve maintainability and readability               | âœ… Builders, handlers, data models, and managers isolate concerns |
| Refresh documentation and onboarding material         | âœ… README, START_HERE, ARCHITECTURE, MIGRATION, TESTING, TRANSFORMATION guides updated |
| Provide testing guidance                              | âœ… Automated unit tests plus manual QA checklist and test guide |

## ðŸ§± Architecture Highlights

- **Entry point:** `src/main.py` initialises Qt, applies high-DPI settings, and launches the `ApplicationController`.
- **UI layer:** `ApplicationController`, `SolverTab`, `DisplayTab`, widget library, and builder modules provide structured UI assembly.
- **Business logic:** `core/computation.py` (AnalysisEngine facade) and `core/visualization.py` (VisualizationManager, AnimationManager, HotspotDetector) handle solver and 3D responsibilities.
- **File handling:** Validators, loaders, and exporters under `src/file_io/` perform structured I/O with clear error messaging.
- **Utilities:** Shared constants and helpers centralised in `src/utils/`.
- **Solver binding:** Legacy `MSUPSmartSolverTransient` maintained in `src/solver/engine.py`, ensuring analytical parity.

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics

- **Module count:** 45 Python files under `src/` (36 implementation modules + 9 package markers).
- **Representative line counts:**  
  - `ui/handlers/analysis_handler.py` â€” 871 lines (solver orchestration, logging, plotting)  
  - `ui/display_tab.py` â€” 596 lines (view) with ~2,100 additional lines across six display handler modules  
  - `ui/solver_tab.py` â€” 517 lines (UI wiring and console integration)  
  - `ui/application_controller.py` â€” 210 lines  
  - `core/computation.py` â€” 228 lines  
  - `core/visualization.py` â€” 332 lines  
  - `solver/engine.py` â€” 1,011 lines (legacy numerical core)
- **Testing:** 4 automated unit-test modules, manual testing checklist updated for the MARS UI, and instructions for running pytest.
- **Documentation:** 20+ Markdown files either refreshed or annotated to indicate historical snapshots.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Impact

- **Lower maintenance cost:** Modular separation accelerates onboarding and reduces regression risk.
- **Clear extension points:** Builders, handlers, and data models allow new features without touching legacy solver internals.
- **Consistent branding:** MARS naming present in the UI, documentation, and project structure.
- **Operational confidence:** Tests and manual checklists provide repeatable validation prior to releases.

## ðŸ”œ Recommendations

1. Use `START_HERE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` when onboarding new developers.
2. Run `pytest tests/ -v` plus the manual checklist before shipping builds.
3. Track further UI simplification (e.g., gradual decomposition of `display_tab.py`) as iterative enhancements.

The transformation from MSUP Smart Solver to MARS is completeâ€”the project is ready for ongoing delivery and innovation.
