- Solver completed with Von-Mises stress output
- Animation time range: 0.3s to 0.8s (not starting at t=0 to demonstrate difference)
- Deformation scale factor: 2.0
- Custom time step mode with 0.05s intervals

TEST STEPS:

1. Complete solver run with Von-Mises stress and Include Deformations enabled
2. Switch to Display tab after solver completion
3. Locate "Show Absolute Deformations" checkbox in Visualization Controls group
4. Verify checkbox is visible and unchecked by default (Relative mode)
5. Hover over checkbox to verify tooltip explains both modes
6. Set animation time range: Start = 0.3 seconds, End = 0.8 seconds  
7. Set time step mode to "Custom Time Step" with step = 0.05 seconds
8. Set deformation scale factor to 2.0
9. Click Play to start animation in Relative mode (checkbox unchecked)
10. Observe that first animation frame appears at undeformed mesh position
11. Note the motion pattern during animation playback
12. Stop animation after a few frames
13. CHECK the "Show Absolute Deformations" checkbox (switch to Absolute mode)
14. Click Play again to start animation in Absolute mode
15. Observe that first animation frame now shows deformed position
16. Compare motion pattern - should show same relative motion but from different starting position
17. Stop animation and verify stress scalar values displayed on mesh
18. Toggle checkbox back to unchecked (Relative mode)
19. Play animation briefly and note scalar values remain unchanged
20. Verify time text overlay updates correctly in both modes

EXPECTED RESULTS:

Relative Mode (Checkbox Unchecked - Default):
- Checkbox is unchecked when controls first become visible
- Tooltip explains "Shows motion relative to start frame" when hovering
- First animation frame (t=0.3s) appears at original undeformed mesh position
- Animation shows motion pattern relative to animation start time
- Visualization emphasizes dynamics and oscillations
- Better for presentations showing motion behavior

Absolute Mode (Checkbox Checked):
- Checkbox becomes checked when clicked
- First animation frame (t=0.3s) shows true deformed position
- Animation includes pre-existing deformation from t=0 to t=0.3s
- Shows absolute displacement values throughout animation
- Better for quantitative analysis and validation

Both Modes (Critical Verification):
- Stress scalar values (Von-Mises) are IDENTICAL - checkbox does NOT affect physics
- Time text overlay updates correctly showing current simulation time
- Animation playback is smooth without stuttering in both modes
- Deformation scale factor (2.0) applies equally in both modes
- Animation controls (Pause, Play, Stop) work identically
- Frame rate and playback speed are identical
- Scalar bar range remains consistent
- Exported animations preserve the selected mode

TITLE: Large File Loading with Progress Indicators (v0.97)

DESCRIPTION: Validates progress indicator system for large modal files (>100 MB) with real-time feedback, adaptive ETA, and performance tracking

INPUTS:

- Large modal stress file (>100 MB, e.g., 1.8 GB with 50,000+ nodes and 200+ modes)
- Large modal deformation file (>100 MB)
- Large modal coordinate file (>100 MB)
- Application at v0.97 with tqdm installed

TEST STEPS:

1. Launch MARS application and navigate to Main Window tab
2. Click Read Modal Coordinate File and select large .mcf file (>100 MB)
3. Observe console output for progress indicators including:
   - File size display
   - "Large file detected" message
   - Validation status
   - Reading progress with elapsed time updates (every 5 seconds)
   - Completion message with total time and metrics
4. Click Read Modal Stress File and select large .csv file (>100 MB)
5. Verify progress indicators appear with estimated time
6. Observe periodic progress updates during CSV reading
7. Note the actual load time and throughput (MB/s) displayed
8. Load another large stress file and verify ETA becomes more accurate (adaptive learning)
9. Restart application and load same file - verify ETA is accurate immediately (persistent cache)
10. Load small file (< 100 MB) and verify no progress indicators appear (silent loading)

EXPECTED RESULTS:

- Large files (>100 MB) show detailed progress indicators in console
- Progress includes: file size, validation status, estimated time, periodic updates, completion metrics
- Estimated time becomes more accurate with each load (adaptive learning)
- Performance cache persists across application restarts (~/.mars_loader_performance.json)
- Small files (< 100 MB) load silently without progress spam
- Console shows clean formatting: "Modes: X, Time Points: Y" or "Nodes: X, Modes: Y"
- Throughput metrics (MB/s) displayed for large files
- GUI remains responsive during file loading (can see console updates in real-time)

REQUIREMENT NO: Performance Enhancement

TITLE: Background Threading and GUI Responsiveness (v0.97)

DESCRIPTION: Validates that file loading and solver execution run in background threads without freezing the GUI

INPUTS:

- Large modal stress file (1+ GB)
- Large modal coordinate file
- Valid analysis configuration (outputs selected)
- Application at v0.97

TEST STEPS:

1. Click Read Modal Stress File and select large file (1+ GB)
2. During file loading, verify:
   - Console shows "⏳ Loading stress file in background..." message
   - GUI remains responsive (window can be moved, tabs can be switched)
   - Console updates appear in real-time during loading
   - Progress messages appear as file loads (not all at once after)
3. After file loads successfully, verify UI is re-enabled automatically
4. Load modal coordinate file and repeat responsiveness checks
5. Configure solver outputs (select Von Mises, Max Principal)
6. Click SOLVE button
7. During solver execution, verify:
   - Console shows "⏳ Running analysis in background..." message
   - GUI remains responsive but solver tab is disabled
   - Progress bar updates smoothly during execution
   - Console shows solver progress messages in real-time
8. After solve completes, verify:
   - UI is re-enabled automatically
   - Results appear correctly
   - Plots are created/updated
   - No errors in console

EXPECTED RESULTS:

- File loading never freezes GUI (background thread)
- Solver execution never freezes GUI (background thread)
- Console updates appear in real-time, not all at once after completion
- Progress bar updates smoothly during operations
- Solver tab is disabled during solve (prevents conflicts)
- UI automatically re-enables after operations complete
- No Qt threading errors (AttributeError, etc.)
- Window remains movable and responsive during operations
- Can switch to other tabs during file loading (but not during solve)
