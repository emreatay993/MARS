# üöÄ Engineering Leader Brief ‚Äî MARS Structural Analysis Platform

**Audience:** Mechanical team lead overseeing engine component design, analysts, and certification workflows  
**Purpose:** Highlight how MARS accelerates structural analysis post-processing, trims turnaround times, and reduces dependence on high-cost commercial seats.

## üìà What MARS Delivers for Your Team

- **Rapid post-processing:** Batch and time-history runs complete without jumping into ANSYS/Workbench for plotting. MARS emits ready-to-use CSV outputs, hotspot tables, and APDL initial-condition decks in one click.
- **Consistent dashboards:** Analysts open the display tab, load solver outputs, and instantly see von Mises, principal stresses, and deformation animations‚Äîwith point picking and hotspot ranking baked in.
- **License cost relief:** Replacing ‚Äúview-only‚Äù ANSYS seats with MARS for post-processing cuts down on premium license consumption. Engineers keep commercial licenses earmarked for solving, not plotting.
- **Design iteration speed:** Engineers can tweak input signals, run the transient solver, and compare time-history results inside MARS within minutes. No exporting/importing between multiple tools.
- **Extensible for engine modules:** Python-based architecture lets your developers bolt on custom calculations (e.g., bearing life factors, fatigue margins) without waiting for vendor roadmaps.

## üîß Daily Workflow Impact

| Routine Task | Current Pain | With MARS |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Reviewing stress envelopes across hundreds of nodes | Multiple ANSYS sessions, manual slicing | Batch run generates ‚Äúmax over time‚Äù datasets and hotspot lists automatically |
| Investigating a critical node from the test article | Manual CSV export and Excel plots | Double-click hotspot ‚Üí time history auto-plotted inside solver tab |
| Preparing animation snapshots for design reviews | Screen captures in ANSYS, one-by-one | Precompute frames, play, pause, and export in a single place |
| Sharing data with durability group | Licensing + format friction | Standardised CSV/JSON outputs from MARS integrate straight into internal pipelines |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Highlights Relevant to Engine Programs

- **Time-History Mode:** Target any node (blade root, bearing support, bracket) and overlay velocity/acceleration traces for transient events.
- **Hotspot Detection:** Surface the top-N critical nodes with coordinates and values‚Äîideal for targeted design remediation.
- **APDL Export:** Feed initial conditions back into ANSYS mechanical for downstream investigations without redo-ing manual setup.
- **Animation Playback:** Visualise deformation and stress evolution throughout the load cycle to support design reviews and supplier discussions.
- **Batch Automation:** Skip GUI altogether‚ÄîMARS can be scripted to ingest new solver outputs nightly, generating standard report packets automatically.

## üí° Why Not Stick with ANSYS for Post-Processing?

| Consideration | ANSYS Workbench | MARS Advantage |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| License utilisation | Consumes full-feature seats even for plotting | Run on local Python environment; no solver licensing needed |
| Custom logic | Scripting requires MAPDL/ACT customization | Pure Python‚Äîyour team controls the roadmap |
| Turnaround time | UI-heavy workflows, manual exports | Predefined pipelines with reusable handlers + templates |
| Collaboration | Files tethered to ANSYS projects | Standard file outputs for lightweight sharing and version control |

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration and Rollout

1. **Pilot with a current engine module.** Replace the analyst‚Äôs post-processing steps with MARS; benchmark time savings and license usage.
2. **Standardise templates.** Use the built-in builders and handlers to ship company-branded output packages (plots, tables, hotspot lists).
3. **Automate nightly.** Hook your test or CAE pipelines to feed solver results to MARS, generating dashboards before the morning stand-up.
4. **Train part designers.** Short guided sessions (read START_HERE.md, run through time history + hotspot workflows) get designers self-sufficient.

## üìö Quick References

- `START_HERE.md` ‚Äî 10-minute onboarding for new users.
- `README.md` ‚Äî Installation, solver workflows, and testing commands.
- `SIGNAL_SLOT_REFERENCE.md` ‚Äî How solver outputs push into visualisations.
- `tests/MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` ‚Äî Regression checklist to validate builds before release.

## ‚úÖ Bottom Line for Engineering Leadership

MARS lets your analysts focus on insights instead of tool choreography:

- **Faster design loops:** Minutes to regenerate stress plots and animations.
- **Lower software spend:** Dedicate ANSYS licenses where they matter‚Äîsolving, not viewing.
- **Future-proof:** Modular Python core means you own the roadmap, from new part-family metrics to supplier-specific reports.

Adopt MARS as the default post-processing cockpit, and reserve commercial tools for what they do best‚Äîsolving the physics. Your team gains speed, flexibility, and cost control in one move.
