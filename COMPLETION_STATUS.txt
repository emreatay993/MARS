⏳ Context Menu Features (0%)

BUGS FIXED: 5
- Module name conflict
- Initialization order
- LaTeX formatting
- Max/Min plot tabs
- Checkbox toggle crash

CURRENT STATUS:
The application is fully functional for all core solver workflows.
Animation and context menu features require additional implementation
to match legacy code completely.

Recommendation: Current version is production-ready for solver workflows.
Animation/context menu can be added incrementally if needed.
