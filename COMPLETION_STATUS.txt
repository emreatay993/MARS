MARS Modernisation – Completion Status
======================================

Current Completion: 100%

FULLY COMPLETE:
✅ Architecture & Structure  
✅ File I/O Layer  
✅ Solver Features (batch, time-history, exports, fatigue)  
✅ Display Features (time point, hotspot tools, animation workflow)  
✅ Documentation (README, START_HERE, ARCHITECTURE, MIGRATION, TRANSFORMATION, summaries)  
✅ Automated Tests (validators, data models, file utilities, node utilities)  
✅ Manual QA Checklist (updated for MARS window title)  
✅ Bug Fixes Retained (hover annotations, scalar bar refresh, time-history stability, etc.)

REMAINING WORK:
None pending within the refactor scope. Future enhancements (e.g., further splitting `display_tab.py`) can be scheduled separately.

Recommendation:
Ship the project as **MARS: Modal Analysis Response Solver v1.0.0 (Modular)**. The codebase, documentation, and test artefacts are in sync with the new branding and architecture.
