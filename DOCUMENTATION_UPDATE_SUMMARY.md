# Documentation Refresh Summary — MARS

**Date:** Current session  
**Scope:** Align project documentation with the MARS rebrand and current source structure  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

The primary documentation set has been reviewed and updated to reflect the current state of the codebase, the MARS naming convention, and the latest module layout under `src/`. Historical status reports have been kept for reference but now include callouts indicating their archival nature.

---

## Updated Guides

| File | Key Updates |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Clarified the MARS branding, refreshed quick-start instructions, and referenced the `src/` package layout. |
| `START_HERE.md` | Reworded the introduction for MARS, refreshed highlights, and removed outdated metrics. |
| `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` | Retitled as a migration path from the legacy MSUP Smart Solver to MARS and clarified terminology. |
| `TRANSFORMATION_SUMMARY.md` | Rewritten with accurate before/after comparisons and current module references. |
| `PROJECT_COMPLETE.md` | Summarised final deliverables with up-to-date counts and highlights. |
| `FINAL_DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` | Condensed and aligned with the new architecture overview. |
| `FINAL_DELIVERY_COMPLETE.md` | Updated to describe the delivered artefacts using MARS naming. |
| `FINAL_SUMMARY.md` | Reauthored as a concise post-project recap with accurate instructions. |
| `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` | Rewritten for stakeholders with the new objectives/outcomes framing. |
| `TESTING_GUIDE.md` & `MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` | Adjusted titles and expectations to reference the MARS UI. |

Historical reports such as `STATUS_REPORT.md`, `PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`, and `FINAL_PROJECT_STATE.md` now open with a note explaining that they capture earlier checkpoints.

## Metrics & References

- **Documentation touched:** 15 Markdown files (including historical annotations).
- **Current module count:** 37 Python files beneath `src/`.
- **Testing artefacts:** Automated unit tests (`pytest tests/ -v`) plus manual checklist updated for the MARS window title.
- **Key architecture reference:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` already reflected the MARS naming and required minimal edits.

## Follow-up

1. Add new user-facing features or configuration options to the README and START_HERE as they ship.
2. When significant architecture changes occur, refresh `TRANSFORMATION_SUMMARY.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` together.
3. Continue annotating historical reports if future milestones generate additional progress snapshots.

Documentation now matches the MARS codebase and is ready for ongoing maintenance.
