# üéâ MARS Modernisation ‚Äî 100% Complete

**Status:** ‚úÖ All planned refactor work delivered  
**Focus:** Legacy MSUP Smart Solver ‚Üí MARS (Modal Analysis Response Solver)  
**Quality:** Production-ready, all known issues resolved

---

## What ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù Means

- MARS branding applied across the UI, documentation, and testing resources.
- Modular source layout (`src/`) with application controller, solver tab, display tab, builders, widgets, core logic, file I/O, utilities, and solver binding.
- Solver workflows (batch, time-history, animation, exports) verified against representative datasets.
- Documentation set refreshed or annotated, providing end-to-end guidance for developers and users.
- Automated unit tests and manual QA checklist run successfully against the refactored build.

---

## Highlights of the Final Push

- Validated animation tooling (play/pause/stop, precomputation, saving) with the updated MARS UI.
- Ensured inter-tab communication (solver ‚Üî display) works after renaming and module reorganisation.
- Confirmed hotspot detection, node picking, and navigator behaviour match the legacy experience.
- Revamped README, START_HERE, and EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY to reference MARS and the current architecture.

## Quick Verification Checklist

- [x] Launch with `python src/main.py`; window title shows **‚ÄúMARS: Modal Analysis Response Solver - v1.0.0 (Modular)‚Äù**.
- [x] Load modal coordinate, stress, deformation, and steady-state files; run batch and time-history solves.
- [x] Trigger animation precomputation, playback, and export.
- [x] Use hotspot finder, selection box, point picking, and go-to-node actions in the display tab.
- [x] Run `pytest tests/ -v`.
- [x] Follow the manual GUI checklist for regression coverage.
- [x] Skim refreshed docs for naming consistency and updated instructions.

## Ready for Release üöÄ

Ship the MARS build with confidence. The refactor, branding alignment, documentation, and testing artefacts are complete.
