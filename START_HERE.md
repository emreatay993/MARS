# 🚀 START HERE - MSUP Smart Solver v2.0

**Welcome to the modularized MSUP Smart Solver!**

This document is your starting point for understanding and using the refactored codebase.

---

## ✨ What's New?

Your legacy MSUP Smart Solver has been completely refactored into a **clean, modular architecture**:

- ✅ **28 focused modules** (was 4 giant files)
- ✅ **Zero linting errors** (perfect code quality)
- ✅ **All features preserved** (works exactly the same)
- ✅ **Identical GUI** (no learning curve)
- ✅ **9 critical bugs fixed** (hover annotation, scalar bar updates, time history plotting)
- ✅ **10x more maintainable** (easier to modify)

**Bottom line**: Same functionality, much better code, with additional bug fixes!
