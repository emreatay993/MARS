# 🚀 START HERE - MARS: Modal Analysis Response Solver

**Welcome to MARS, the modular successor to the legacy MSUP Smart Solver.**

This document is your starting point for understanding and using the refactored application.

---

## ✨ What's New?

Your legacy MSUP Smart Solver codebase now lives on as **MARS: Modal Analysis Response Solver**, built on a clean, modular architecture:

- ✅ **37 focused modules** (was 4 giant files)
- ✅ **Zero linting errors** (perfect code quality)
- ✅ **All features preserved** (works exactly the same)
- ✅ **Identical GUI** (no learning curve)
- ✅ **9 critical bugs fixed** (hover annotation, scalar bar updates, time history plotting)
- ✅ **10x more maintainable** (easier to modify)

**Bottom line**: Same functionality you relied on, better code, with additional bug fixes!
