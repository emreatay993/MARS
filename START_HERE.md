# 🚀 START HERE - MARS: Modal Analysis Response Solver

**Welcome to MARS, the modular successor to the legacy MSUP Smart Solver.**

This document is your starting point for understanding and using the refactored application.

---

## ✨ What's New?

Your legacy MSUP Smart Solver codebase now lives on as **MARS: Modal Analysis Response Solver**, built on a clean, modular architecture:

- ✅ **Modular packages**: 36 Python modules (45 files including package initialisers) organised by responsibility
- ✅ **Handler-driven UI**: 15 handler modules manage solver orchestration, state, PyVista rendering, animation, and exports
- ✅ **Legacy solver preserved**: Numerical core remains in `src/solver/engine.py` (1011 lines) for parity with the original engine
- ✅ **All features preserved**: Identical workflows for batch solves, time history, visualisation, hotspots, and exports
- ✅ **Documentation & testing refreshed**: README, architecture, migration, and testing guides align with the latest `src/` layout
- ✅ **Bug fixes retained**: Hover annotation, scalar bar refresh, and time-history stability improvements remain in place

**Bottom line**: Same functionality you relied on, better code, with additional bug fixes!

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### For You (Developer)
- ✅ **Find code in seconds** (clear structure)
- ✅ **Understand code quickly** (handlers isolate responsibilities)
- ✅ **Modify code safely** (changes isolated)
- ✅ **Test code easily** (pure functions in core/file I/O layers)

### For Users
- ✅ **Same exact interface** (no changes)
- ✅ **All features work** (nothing removed)
- ✅ **Better reliability** (more tested)

### For Team
- ✅ **Faster onboarding** (clear docs)
- ✅ **Faster development** (modular)
- ✅ **Less risk** (changes isolated)
- ✅ **Higher quality** (enforced standards)

## 🎓 What Changed?

### Code Structure
- **Before**: 4 monolithic files mixing UI, solver orchestration, and visualisation
- **After**: 36 feature-focused modules (45 Python files including package initialisers) grouped under `core/`, `file_io/`, `solver/`, `ui/`, and `utils/`
- **Benefit**: Clear package boundaries and predictable locations for every responsibility

### Code Quality
- **Before**: Long functions, global state, and UI tightly coupled to computation
- **After**: Tab widgets focus on wiring while 15 handler modules encapsulate file loading, validation, solving, logging, PyVista rendering, animation, and exports
- **Benefit**: Targeted edits reduce regression risk and make intensive flows easier to reason about

### Maintainability
- **Before**: Any change required editing 3,000+ line widgets
- **After**: Solver orchestration lives in `ui/handlers/analysis_handler.py` (871 lines) and display logic is split across dedicated handler modules (~2,100 lines combined) plus a 596-line view
- **Benefit**: Clear entry points for batch solves, time history, animation, hotspot detection, and exporting
